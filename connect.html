      Creating, designing, and building is Daniel's bread and butter, seeing as
      he grew up in a house that his father is still trying to complete to this day!
      Daniel started swinging a hammer before he could walk and spent his entire childhood
      helping his father build the family dream home. After college, Daniel spent 12 years
      in the church as a youth director teaching and leading children of all ages.
      During his tenure at the church he had to make quite a few lemonade stands for the
      vacation bible school programs in the summer and always thought there had to be a
      better way.
      </p>

      <p>
      Today, Daniel is a first time father with a healthy newborn baby boy in Calgary.
      He works with a local non-profit in a town that helps professional athlentes and
      para athletes mentor classroom children all over North America
